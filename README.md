# Keychain / BusinessKey Chain / Business Card - Password / SSH secure trust wallet 
New Authentication -  Portable, Pro, and system to system. Side channel and glitch resistant, fingerprint and iris, dual biometric, upgradable, each new version state of the art in security resistant, tamper resistant, new algorithms, WolfSSL bootloader protected, DNA ID chip proprietary cables, two device min, clone to new device. 
A new idea i will try and crank out via KICA for the hackaday buiness card challenge. 
Further iterations will be a keychain dual set similar to a security key but with more functionally and side channel and glitch resistant design.
The first will be a unique business card supportting my ideology that passwords need to go. 
They represent one of the biggest security issues which people are unwilling to use  
Since the advent of a Chian of Trust and certificates - GPG / PGP - people refuse to use these technologies.
I have sent PGP and GPG certs to manu people kn the past and to this day very few use these. 
All the while people complain about privacy in electronic communication like Whatsapp / Telegram/ Signal!
The abilty to quickly exchange public keys with your contacts has existed for decades.
In addition, simole mashine to Mashine Keys can be inserted into USB or deeper in M.2. dedicated slots made for encryption keys with secure trust zones.
Potted components and / or tamper resistant shields with the component pads sunk deep within a multiple layer board with additional side channel and glitch resistant measures.
With the use of self-erasing storage with offline back-up of the onboard keys could be loaded onto a new chip with litle issue.
It is an issue merely of good record keeping and backup practices.
If your data going to any cloud storage was pre-encrypted with for example one of the two vacant M.2 slots on my tower for AI / Model development. 
That slot could be repurposed in bios as an encryption accelerator and have it's own onboard trng, plenty or extra memory for different security use cases and coild communicate with a paired USB device for portablabliy. 
The security M.2. could be keyed to several MAC address and a UID of the processor and other communication I/0 devices. 
It would only allow the keys and passwords or certificates you need if you were to take it portable.  
Any attempts to cause glitch or power supply analysis would cause as your onboard M.2. chip to erase your portable keychain device while all your information remains secure in your tower / server. 
An offline backup held in a secure offline location. 
It will take some getting used to and 2 factor authentication device would be a NO RADIO containing device. 
Every time you add a radio you open a massive attack surface.
this day even the most secure wireless Systems if you capture enough and shakes you're going to be able to eventually catch enough of the key.

The long-term use of the same SSH key in symmetric encryption but also provide a vulnerability. 

we shouldn't be worried about quantum computers this much as we should be amount I complete paradigm Shift brought about by the quickly approaching reach of the van nouman bottleneck. the new Grace Hopper and I've been with interconnect in the insanely dance parallel processing units of the modern GPU clusters are going to assume pose a serious wrist to encryption if they haven't already
